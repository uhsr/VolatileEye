# VolatileEye: Real-Time Crypto Anomaly Detection

Leveraging blockchain data to predict volatility spikes and trigger automated alerts.

VolatileEye is a Golang-based platform designed for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection within cryptocurrency markets. It provides a low-latency data ingestion pipeline from multiple blockchain sources, coupled with sophisticated algorithmic volatility prediction models. The system aims to identify potential market fluctuations before they become widespread, allowing users to react proactively and mitigate risks or capitalize on opportunities. By analyzing transaction patterns, order book dynamics, and other on-chain data, VolatileEye provides a powerful tool for traders, analysts, and institutional investors.

The core value proposition of VolatileEye lies in its ability to deliver timely and accurate insights into market behavior. This is achieved through a combination of high-throughput data processing, advanced statistical modeling, and a flexible alerting system. The platform is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing users to integrate custom data sources, prediction algorithms, and notification channels. VolatileEye not only detects historical anomalies but also aims to forecast potential future volatility based on learned patterns and real-time data feeds.

VolatileEye is engineered for performance and reliability. Written in Go, it benefits from the language's concurrency features and efficient resource management, ensuring that the system can handle large volumes of data with minimal latency. The platform also incorporates robust error handling and monitoring capabilities to ensure continuous operation and data integrity. This allows for deployment in demanding production environments where uptime and data accuracy are critical.

## Key Features

*   **Real-Time Blockchain Data Ingestion:** Implements gRPC-based data streams from multiple blockchain nodes, parsing transactions and block data with sub-second latency. Utilizes protobuf definitions for efficient data serialization and deserialization.
*   **Algorithmic Volatility Prediction:** Employs a time-series analysis model based on Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) to predict short-term volatility. Supports customizable window sizes and alpha values.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** A configurable rule engine that identifies anomalies based on deviations from expected volatility, unusual transaction patterns, and order book imbalances. Supports custom rule definitions using a simple expression language.
*   **Automated Alerting System:** Triggers alerts via configurable notification channels, including email, Slack, and webhooks, when anomalies are detected or volatility thresholds are breached. Implements rate limiting to prevent alert fatigue.
*   **Data Visualization Dashboard:** Provides a web-based dashboard for visualizing real-time market data, volatility predictions, and anomaly events. Uses Grafana for flexible chart configuration and data exploration.
*   **Modular and Extensible Architecture:** Designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy integration of new data sources, prediction algorithms, and notification channels. Supports custom plugins written in Go.
*   **High-Performance Concurrency:** Leverages Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) for parallel data processing and asynchronous event handling, ensuring low latency and high throughput.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The primary programming language, chosen for its performance, concurrency features, and strong standard library.
*   **gRPC:** Used for inter-service communication and blockchain data ingestion, providing high-performance and efficient data transfer.
*   **Protocol Buffers (protobuf):** Used for serializing and deserializing data, ensuring efficient data exchange between services.
*   **InfluxDB:** A time-series database used for storing and querying market data, volatility predictions, and anomaly events.
*   **Grafana:** A data visualization and monitoring platform used for creating dashboards and visualizing real-time market data.
*   **Redis:** Used as a caching layer to improve performance and reduce latency when accessing frequently used data.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/uhsr/VolatileEye.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd VolatileEye`
3.  Install dependencies:
    `go mod download`
4.  Build the application:
    `go build -o volatileeye main.go`
5.  Install InfluxDB, Grafana, and Redis (if not already installed). Refer to their respective documentation for installation instructions.
6.  Configure the application (see Configuration section).

## Configuration

VolatileEye relies on environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and populate it with the following variables:



*   `BLOCKCHAIN_NODE_URL`: The URL of the gRPC endpoint for the blockchain node.
*   `INFLUXDB_URL`: The URL of the InfluxDB instance.
*   `INFLUXDB_TOKEN`: The InfluxDB API token.
*   `INFLUXDB_ORG`: The InfluxDB organization.
*   `INFLUXDB_BUCKET`: The InfluxDB bucket to store data.
*   `REDIS_URL`: The URL of the Redis instance.
*   `ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENT`: The email address to send alert notifications to.
*   `ALERT_SLACK_WEBHOOK`: The Slack webhook URL to send alert notifications to.

## Usage

1.  Run the application:
    `./volatileeye`
2.  Access the Grafana dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` to visualize market data and anomaly events.
3.  Configure anomaly detection rules and alert thresholds through the application's configuration file (not yet implemented, planned for future release).

The application exposes no direct API endpoints. All interaction is currently performed through the Grafana dashboard and alert notifications. Future versions will include a dedicated API for configuration and data retrieval.
