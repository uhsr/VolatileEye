# VolatileEye: Transient Data Observer

VolatileEye is a Go-based utility designed for observing and reacting to temporary or ephemeral data states. Its core function is to monitor specific data points, trigger actions based on their transient existence or modification, and then efficiently release resources when the data is no longer relevant. This is particularly useful in microservices architectures, real-time data processing pipelines, and distributed systems where data consistency and responsiveness to short-lived data events are critical.

The project aims to simplify the process of building applications that rely on handling volatile data. Traditional approaches often involve complex polling mechanisms, resource-intensive background processes, or intricate message queue configurations. VolatileEye abstracts away these complexities by providing a lightweight, configurable framework for defining observation targets, specifying trigger conditions, and executing custom actions. It allows developers to focus on the business logic of their applications, rather than the infrastructure required to manage fleeting data states.

VolatileEye's architecture is modular and extensible, allowing it to be adapted to a wide range of use cases. It supports different data sources through configurable input adapters, enabling integration with various databases, APIs, and message queues. The action execution framework allows developers to define custom handlers that are triggered based on predefined data observation rules. This flexibility makes VolatileEye a powerful tool for building resilient and responsive applications that can effectively manage transient data.

Key Features

*   **Configurable Data Sources:** Supports multiple data input adapters. Currently implements a basic key-value store adapter with a planned extension to include Redis, allowing for observation of changes in stored values.
*   **Rule-Based Triggering:** Defines triggering conditions using a flexible rule engine based on data attributes. Rules are defined using a simple declarative language, enabling complex conditions to be expressed easily.
*   **Asynchronous Action Execution:** Actions are executed asynchronously through goroutines, preventing blocking of the main observation loop and ensuring high throughput.
*   **Resource Management:** Implements efficient resource management by automatically releasing observation targets and associated resources when the data is no longer relevant, minimizing memory footprint.
*   **Extensible Action Handlers:** Allows for the definition of custom action handlers that are executed when a trigger condition is met. Handlers can perform any arbitrary operation, such as sending notifications, updating databases, or invoking other services.
*   **Metrics and Monitoring:** Provides built-in metrics and monitoring capabilities, allowing for tracking of observation target activity, trigger rates, and action execution times. Uses expvar package for exposing metrics.
*   **Concurrency Safe:** All core components are designed to be concurrency-safe, ensuring reliable operation in multi-threaded environments.

Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The primary programming language, chosen for its performance, concurrency capabilities, and ecosystem.
*   **expvar:** Used for exposing internal metrics for monitoring and debugging.
*   **sync.Map:** Utilized to manage data in a concurrency-safe manner.
*   **context:** Used for managing cancellation signals and passing request-scoped values across API boundaries.

Installation

1.  Ensure you have Go installed and configured correctly. Verify by running `go version` in your terminal.
2.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/uhsr/VolatileEye`.
3.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd VolatileEye`.
4.  Build the project: `go build -o volatileeye main.go`.
5.  (Optional) Install the binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory: `go install`.

Configuration

VolatileEye is configured primarily through environment variables:

*   `VE_OBSERVATION_INTERVAL`: The interval, in seconds, at which observation targets are checked for changes. Default is 5 seconds.
*   `VE_DATA_SOURCE_TYPE`: Specifies the type of data source to use. Currently, only "keyvalue" is supported.
*   `VE_KEYVALUE_STORE_SIZE`: The initial size of the key-value store. Default is 100.
*   `VE_ACTION_HANDLER_TYPE`: Specifies the type of action handler to use. Currently, only "log" is supported, which writes to standard output.

You can set these environment variables in your shell or in a `.env` file.

Usage

To run VolatileEye, execute the built binary: `./volatileeye`.

To interact with the system, you can use the provided API endpoints. Example:

Set a key-value pair via a hypothetical API endpoint:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"mykey","value":"myvalue"}' http://localhost:8080/set

Define an observation rule (this would typically be done through a separate configuration file loaded at startup):

Rule: Observe "mykey" and trigger the "log" action when its value changes.

The system will then monitor the value of "mykey" and log a message to the console whenever it changes.
